Seat belts provide frontal collision protection and are essential for safe driving.
"• Ensure  that  all  seat  belts  are  worn
correctly.  An  improperly  worn  seat
belt  increases  the  risk  of  injury  or
death if a collision occurs.

• Seat belts should always be adjusted

as follows:
– the  lap  portion  of  the  belt  should
be worn low across the pelvis, not
across the waist.

– the  shoulder  straps  should  be
worn on the outside shoulder only,
and never under the arm.

– the  shoulder  straps  should  be
away from your face and neck, but
not falling off your shoulder.

• Seat belts should never be worn with
the  straps  twisted  and  should  be
adjusted as tightly as  is comfortable
to  provide  the  protection  for  which
they  have  been  designed.  A  slack
belt will provide less protection than

WARNING

– If  a  child  put  a  hand  out  of  the
window  or  lean  on  a  door,  the
child  may  get  severe  injury  by  a
strong  impact  of  side  or  curtain
airbag activation. 
Do  not  allow  a  child  to  put  hand
out  of  the  window  or  lean  on  a
door.

• Do not allow the hands or feet, etc.,
of a child near movable parts inside
a vehicle, such as the armrests and
the  seat  rails.  Otherwise,  there  is
the possibility of injury.

• Do  not  drive  with  a  child  on  your
lap.  Even  if  you  hold  the  child
tightly, proper support is not possi-
ble, and in the event of a collision,
etc.,  the  child  may  get  serious
injury.

• If a child does not wear a seat belt,
in a sudden braking and a collision,
the child may get serious injury. 
Be sure to always have a child wear
a seat belt.",What precautions should be taken to ensure the safety of children in a vehicle?,"To ensure the safety of children in a vehicle, it is important to follow these precautions:
 
 1. Do not allow a child to put their hand out of the window or lean on a door, as they may get severe injury from the impact of side or curtain airbag activation.
 2. Keep the hands or feet of a child away from movable parts inside the vehicle, such as armrests and seat rails, to prevent the possibility of injury.
 3. Never drive with a child on your lap, as even if you hold them tightly, proper support is not possible and they may sustain serious injury in the event of a collision.
 4. Always ensure that a child wears a seat belt, as failure to do so may result in serious injury during sudden braking or a collision."
"• If  two  or  more  people  use  a  single
seat belt, in a sudden braking and a
collision, the seat belt may not pro-
vide  the  best  performance,  result-
ing in severe injury. 
Do not allow two or more people to
use a single seat belt.

WARNING

• The  seat  belts  of  this  vehicle  are
designed  to  be  suitable  for  occu-
pants  of  adult  size.  If  the  shoulder
strap rests on the neck or chin of a
child rather than the shoulder, or if
the lap portion of the belt does not
rest  securely  on 
the  hipbone,
ensure that the child is seated in a
child restraint system placed in the
rear seat. Failure to properly use a
seat  belt  may  result  in  serious
injury to the child.

Front  airbags  are  designed  to  inflate  in
severe  frontal  collisions  when  the  ignition
switch  is  in  “ON”  position  or  the  ignition
mode is ON.

NOTE:
In a frontal angle collision, the side airbags
(if  equipped)  and  side  curtain  airbags  (if
equipped) may inflate.",What should you do if the airbag warning light does not come on or stays on while driving?,"If the airbag warning light does not come on or stays on while driving, you should have the airbag system inspected by a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop as soon as possible."
"Front airbags are not designed to inflate in
rear  impacts,  side  impacts,  rollovers  or
minor  frontal  collisions,  since  they  would
offer  no  protection  in  those  types  of  acci-
dents.  Since  an  airbag  deploys  only  one
time  during  an  accident,  seat  belts  are
needed  to  restrain  occupants  from  further
movements during the accident.
Therefore, an airbag is not a substitute for
seat  belts.  To  maximize  your  protection,
always  fasten  your  seat  belts.  Be  aware
that  no  system  can  prevent  all  possible
injuries that may occur in an accident.

- Do not attach accessories (except for Maruti Suzuki genuine products) to the windshield or the inside rearview mirror."
"How the System Works
In  a  frontal  collision,  the  collision  sensors
will  detect  rapid  deceleration,  and  if  the
controller judges that the deceleration rep-
resents a severe frontal collision, the con-
troller will trigger the inflators. The inflators
inflate  the  appropriate  airbags  with  nitro-
gen or argon gas. The inflated airbags pro-
vide  a  cushion  for  your  head  and  upper
body.  The  airbag  inflates  and  deflates  so
quickly that you may not even realize that it
has  activated.  The  airbag  will  neither  hin-
der your view nor make it harder to exit the
vehicle.
A  seat  belt  helps  keep  you  in  the  proper
position  for  maximum  protection  when  an
airbag  inflates.  Adjust  your  seat  as  far
back  as  possible  while  still  maintaining
control of the vehicle. Sit fully back in your

airbag. Wash off any residue as soon
as possible to prevent skin irritation.
Also, upon inflation, a loud noise will
occur  and  some  powder  and  smoke
will  be  released.  These  conditions
are not harmful and do not indicate a
fire in the vehicle. Be aware, however,
that some airbag components may be
hot for a while after inflation. 
This may cause burn injury.

Your vehicle is equipped with a diagnostic

3) The  light  comes  on  when  under  either

or both of above two conditions.

The  light  also  comes  on  when  the  fluid  in
the  brake  fluid  reservoir  falls  below  the
specified level.

The  light  should  go  out  after  starting  the
engine  and  fully  releasing  the  parking
brake,  if  the  fluid  level  in  the  brake  fluid
reservoir is adequate.

The  light also comes on together with  the
ABS  warning  light  when  the  rear  brake
force  control  function  (proportioning  valve
function) of the ABS system fails.

If the brake system warning light comes on
while  you  are  driving  the  vehicle,  it  may
mean  that  there  is  something  wrong  with
the vehicle’s brake system. If this happens,
you should:

1) Pull off the road and stop carefully.

may be longer, you may have to push
harder  on  the  pedal,  and  the  pedal
may go down farther than normal.

2) Test the brakes by carefully starting and
stopping on the shoulder of the road.
3) If you determine that it is safe, drive the

ENG A-STOP System (Engine 
Auto Stop Start System) (for 
K10C engine) (if equipped)
The  ENG  A-STOP  system  (engine  auto
stop  start  system)  automatically  stops  the
engine while waiting briefly at a traffic light,
etc., and automatically restarts the engine
afterward. This system helps reduce emis-
sions, improve fuel consumption and lower
engine noise.

This  system  stops  the  engine  temporarily
under  specific  conditions.  Before  parking
the vehicle for an extended period of time
or  leaving  the  vehicle,  properly  apply  the
parking brake and stop the engine with the
engine switch.",What is the purpose of the ENG A-STOP system in the vehicle?,"The purpose of the ENG A-STOP system (engine auto stop start system) is to automatically stop the engine while waiting briefly at a traffic light or other similar situations, and then automatically restart the engine afterward. This system helps reduce emissions, improve fuel consumption, and lower engine noise."
"Once  the  specific  conditions  are  met,  the
engine  will  stop  automatically  after  the
vehicle has stopped. However, the engine
will not be stopped automatically until con-
firmation of the system function is finished.

NOTE:
If your vehicle is equipped with the auto air
conditioning  system,  you  can  change  the
automatic  engine  stop  condition  via  the
information  display.  Refer  to  “Information
display” in “BEFORE DRIVING” section.

CAUTION",Can the engine stop automatically after the vehicle has stopped?,"Yes, the engine can stop automatically after the vehicle has stopped."
"CAUTION

• Do not get out of the vehicle while
the engine is automatically stopped
by the ENG A-STOP system. Doing
so may lead to an accident. 
– Manual  transmission  vehicle  –  If
the  driver’s  seat  belt  is  unfas-

• The  parking  sensor  system  uses  ultra-
sonic  sensors  to  detect  obstacles  near
the rear bumper. If obstacles are sensed
while  you  are  parking  or  moving  the
vehicle slowly, the system warns you by
sounding  a  buzzer  and  displaying  sym-
bols  representing  the  obstacles  on  the
information  display  in  the  instrument
cluster.

• The  system  emits  an  ultrasonic  wave
and  the  relevant  sensor  detects  the
return of the wave reflected by an obsta-
cle.  The  system  measures  the  time
taken by the ultrasonic wave to reach the
obstacle and return from it, from which it
determines the obstacle’s position.",How does the parking sensor system detect obstacles near the rear bumper?,"The parking sensor system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles near the rear bumper. It emits an ultrasonic wave and measures the time taken for the wave to reach the obstacle and return. Based on this measurement, it determines the position of the obstacle."
"• The parking sensor function can be used
when you turn the ignition switch to “ON”
position or the engine switch is pressed
to change the ignition mode to “ON”, the
gearshift lever is in the “R” position. This
function is helpful in the following cases:
pulling over to the curb; parallel-parking
the  vehicle;  steering  the  vehicle  into  a
garage; driving along an alley; and mov-
ing slowly in a place with obstacles.

WARNING",When can the parking sensor function be used?,"The parking sensor function can be used when the ignition switch is turned to the ""ON"" position or when the engine switch is pressed to change the ignition mode to ""ON"", and the gearshift lever is in the ""R"" position."
"WARNING

• The  parking  sensor  warns  you  of
obstacles  with  buzzers  and  by
showing  you  the  location  of  the
obstacles  on  the  information  dis-
play.  However,  you  must  still  pay
full attention yourself while driving.
• The  sensors  can  detect  obstacles
only  within  a limited area and only
when the vehicle is moving within a
limited  speed  range.  So,  in  tricky
areas,  you  must  move  the  vehicle
slowly  while  checking  around  it
using your direct vision or rearview
mirrors.  There  is  increased  risk  of
an accident if you control the vehi-
cle relying only on the parking sen-
sor.

OPERATING YOUR VEHICLE

The ESP® has the following systems:

Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
Refer to “Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)” in
this section.",What does it mean if I hear an operation sound or clicking sound while performing certain operations in my vehicle?,"If you hear an operation sound or clicking sound while performing certain operations in your vehicle, it means that the ESP® system is in the self-check mode and this does not indicate a malfunction."
"Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
Refer to “Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)” in
this section.

Brake Assist System
Refer to “Brake Assist System” in this sec-
tion.

Traction Control System
The  traction  control  system  automatically
helps prevent the spinning of wheels when
the  vehicle  is  started  or  accelerated  on
slippery  road  surfaces.  The  system  oper-
ates  only  if  it  senses  that  some  of  the
wheels  are  spinning  or  beginning  to  lose
traction.  When  this  happens,  the  system
operates  the  front  or  rear  brakes  and
reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

Stability Control System
The  vehicle  stability  control  system  helps
provide integrated control of systems such
as anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine
control,  etc.  This  system  automatically
controls the brakes and engine to help pre-
vent  the  vehicle  from  skidding  when  cor-
nering on a slippery road surface or when
turning the steering wheel abruptly.

vehicle  by  pressing  the  brake  pedal
harder  than  normally  required.  How-
ever,  the  stopping  distance  may  be
longer.",What happens if you release your foot from the brake pedal for more than 2 seconds?,"If you release your foot from the brake pedal for more than 2 seconds, the hill hold control system will be canceled. This can result in the vehicle rolling downward, potentially causing an accident depending on the slope. Additionally, the engine may stall and the power assist for the steering and brakes will not work, making steering and braking much harder than usual, which can also lead to accidents or vehicle damage."
"Brake Assist System
When  you  slam  the  brakes  on,  the  brake
assist system determines it to be an emer-
gency  stop  and  provides  more  powerful
braking for a driver who cannot hold down
the brake pedal firmly.

NOTE:
If  you  quickly  and  forcefully  depress  the
brakes,  you  may  hear  clicking  sound  by
the brake  assist system operation. This is
normal and indicates that the brake assist
system is activated properly.

If  water  gets  into  the  brake  devices,
brake performance may become poor
and  unpredictable.  After  driving
through water or washing the under-
side  of  the  vehicle,  test  the  brakes
while driving at a slow speed to see if
they  have  maintained  their  normal
effectiveness.  If  the  brakes  are  less
effective  than  normal,  dry  them  by
repeatedly applying the brakes while
driving  slowly  until  the  brakes  have
regained their normal effectiveness.",What does the brake assist system do when the brakes are slammed on?,The brake assist system provides more powerful braking for a driver who cannot hold down the brake pedal firmly when the brakes are slammed on.
"NOTE:
While  braking  you  may  hear  operational
noise  due  to  friction  between  brake  disc/
drum  and  brake  lining.  This  is  a  normal
phenomenon  and  does  not  indicate  any
abnormality or affect normal functioning of
the vehicle.

Power-assisted Brakes
Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If
power  assistance  is  lost  due  to  a  stalled
engine or other failures, the system is still
fully operational on reserve power and you
can bring the vehicle to a complete stop by
pressing the brake pedal once and holding
it  down. The  reserve  power  is  partly  used
up when you depress the brake pedal and
reduces  each  time  the  pedal  is  pressed.
Apply  smooth  and  even  pressure  to  the
pedal. Do not pump the pedal.

• When  driving  on  steep  hills,  the  vehicle
may begin to slow down and show a lack
of  power.  If  this  happens,  you  should
shift  to  a  lower  gear  so  that  the  engine

power range. Shift rapidly to prevent the
vehicle from losing momentum.

• When  driving  down  a  hill,  the  engine
should be used for braking by shifting to
the next lower gear.

WARNING

Do not hold the brake pedal down too
long or too often while going down a
steep  or  long  hill.  This  could  cause
the  brakes  to  overheat,  resulting  in

ADVICE FOR YOUR DRIVING

Improving Fuel Economy

NOTE:
Fuel economy (mileage) of the vehicle may
vary due to several factors i.e. driving hab-
its-gear  change  pattern,  usage  of A.C, Air
pressure  in  the  tyres,  wind  speed,  traffic
conditions, 
fuel  quality-non  adulterated
standard  fuel,  maintenance  of  vehicle,
road conditions, braking etc.

The  following  instructions  will  help  you
improve fuel economy.

Keep Tyre Pressures Correct
Under-inflation of the tyres can waste fuel
due to increased running resistance of the
tyres.  Keep  your  tyres  inflated  to  the  cor-
rect  pressure  shown  on  the  label  on  the
driver’s side door or the driver’s door lock
pillar.

Keep Weight to a Minimum
The heavier the load is, the more fuel the
vehicle  consumes.  Unload  any  unneces-
sary luggage or cargo.",What are some factors that can affect the fuel economy of a vehicle?,"Some factors that can affect the fuel economy of a vehicle include driving habits, gear change pattern, usage of air conditioning, air pressure in the tires, wind speed, traffic conditions, fuel quality, maintenance of the vehicle, road conditions, and braking."
"Avoid Excessive idling
If you park your vehicle for more than one
minute,  stop  the  engine  and  start  it  again
later. When warming up a cold engine, do
not  allow  the  engine  to  idle  or  apply  full
throttle until the engine has reached oper-
ating  temperature.  Allow  the  engine  to
warm up by driving.

6-9

Do not Race the Engine

Revving  the  engine  only  consumes  extra
fuel and has no benefit.

69RHS060

NOTICE
Immediately after starting, the engine
is  often  not  yet  fully  warmed  up.
Therefore,  revving  the  engine,  start-
ing to drive suddenly, or rapid accel-
eration can cause engine failure.

Drive with an Appropriate Gear for 
Vehicle Speed
Running the vehicle at a high engine rota-
tion speed  by  using a  low-speed  gear will
result  in  poor  fuel  economy.  Use  the  cor-
rect gear according to the vehicle speed.

If the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there
will  be  greater  intake  resistance,  resulting
in  decreased  power  output  and  increased
fuel consumption.

Stuck Vehicle
If your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud or
sand, follow the directions below:

1) Shift  the  transmission  back  and  forth
between  a  forward  range  (or  first  gear
for manual transmission) and reverse.
This will create a rocking motion which
may  give  you  enough  momentum  to
free  the  vehicle.  Press  gently  on  the
accelerator to keep wheel spinning to a
minimum wheel rpm. Remove your foot
from  the  accelerator  while  shifting.  Do
not  race  the  engine.  Excessive  wheel
spin will cause the tyres to dig deeper,
making it more difficult to free the vehi-
cle.

NOTE:
You may have to turn the ESP® system off
in order to allow spinning the wheels.",What can happen if the air cleaner is clogged with dust?,"If the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there will be greater intake resistance, resulting in decreased power output and increased fuel consumption."
"NOTE:
You may have to turn the ESP® system off

2) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few
minutes of rocking, we recommend you
to  consult  a  Maruti  Suzuki  authorized
workshop or a roadside assistance ser-
vice. If a towing service is not available
in  an  emergency,  your  vehicle  may  be
temporarily towed by a towing cable or
chain  secured  to  the  towing  eye  either
on the front or rear of the vehicle. Refer
to “Towing by Using Towing Eye” in the
“EMERGENCY SERVICE” section.

WARNING

• Do not  allow anyone to  stand near
the vehicle when you are rocking it,
and  do  not  spin  the  wheels  faster
than  an  indicated  40  km/h  on  the
speedometer.  Personal  injury  and/
or vehicle damage may result from
spinning the wheels too fast.

Catalytic Converter

NOTICE
The  future  performance  and  reliabil-
ity of the engine depends on the care
and  restraint  exercised  during  its
early life. It is especially important to
observe  the  following  precautions
during  the  first  960  km  of  vehicle
operation.
• After  starting,  do  not  race  the

engine. Warm it up gradually.

• Avoid  prolonged  vehicle  operation
at  a  constant  speed.  Moving  parts
will break in better if you vary your
speed.

• Start  off  from  a  stop  slowly. Avoid",What are the different viscosity options for engine oil specified in the manual?,"The different viscosity options for engine oil specified in the manual are 5W-30, 10W-30, and 10W-40."
"• Start  off  from  a  stop  slowly. Avoid

full throttle starts.

• Avoid  hard  braking,  especially
during the first 320 km of driving.
• Do not  drive slowly with the  trans-

mission in a high gear.

• Drive 

the  vehicle  at  moderate

engine speeds.

• Do not tow a trailer during the first

960 km of vehicle operation.

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to
minimize the amount of harmful pollutants
in  your  vehicle’s  exhaust.  Use  of  leaded
fuel  in  vehicles  equipped  with  catalytic
converters  is  prohibited,  because  lead
deactivates  the  pollutant-reducing  compo-
nents of the catalyst system.",What is the purpose of the catalytic converter in a vehicle?,The purpose of the catalytic converter in a vehicle is to minimize the amount of harmful pollutants in the vehicle's exhaust.
"The converter is designed to last the life of
the vehicle under normal usage and when
unleaded  fuel  is  used.  No  special  mainte-
nance  is  required  on  the  converter.  How-
ever, it is very important to keep the engine
properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can
result  from  an  improperly  tuned  engine,
may  cause  overheating  of  the  catalytic
converter.  This  may  result  in  permanent
heat damage to the catalytic converter and
other vehicle components.

NOTICE
To  minimize  the  possibility  of  cata-
lytic  converter  or  other  vehicle  dam-
age:
• Maintain  the  engine  in  the  proper

operating condition.

• In  the  event  of  an  engine  malfunc-
tion,  particularly  one 
involving
engine  misfire  or  other  apparent
loss of performance, have the vehi-
cle serviced promptly.

• Do not turn off the engine or inter-
rupt the ignition when the transmis-
sion is in gear and the vehicle is in
motion.",What is the recommended maintenance for the catalytic converter?,"No special maintenance is required on the catalytic converter. However, it is important to keep the engine properly tuned to prevent engine misfiring, which can cause overheating of the catalytic converter."
"• Do  not  try  to  start  the  engine  by
pushing  or  towing  the  vehicle,  or
coasting down a hill.

• Do  not  idle  the  engine  with  any
spark  plug  wires  disconnected  or
removed,  such  as  during  diagnos-
tic testing.

• Do  not  idle  the  vehicle  for  pro-
longed  periods

ADVICE FOR YOUR DRIVING

Warming up before driving
Since  the  gasoline  engine  starts  up  and
cuts out automatically when cold, warming
up  the  engine  is  unnecessary.  Moreover,
frequently  driving  short  distances  will
cause  the  engine  to  repeatedly  warm  up,
which  can  lead  to  excess  fuel  consump-
tion.

When Driving Hybrid Vehicle
For economical and ecological driving, pay
attention to the following points:",What should you avoid doing when trying to start the engine of the vehicle?,"You should avoid trying to start the engine by pushing or towing the vehicle, or coasting down a hill."
"Shift lever operation
Shift the shift lever to D when stopped at a
traffic  light,  or  driving  in  heavy  traffic  etc.
Shift the shift lever to P when parking. 
When  using  the  N,  there  is  no  positive
effect on fuel consumption. 
In the N, the gasoline engine operates but
electricity cannot be generated.
Also,  when using the air conditioning  sys-
tem,  etc.,  the  hybrid  battery  (traction  bat-
tery) power is consumed.

Accelerator pedal/brake pedal oper-
ation
• Drive  your  vehicle  smoothly.  Avoid
abrupt  acceleration  and  deceleration.
Gradual  acceleration  and  deceleration
will make more effective use of the elec-
tric motor (traction motor) without having
to use gasoline engine power.

• Avoid  repeated  acceleration.  Repeated
acceleration  consumes  hybrid  battery
(traction battery) power, resulting in poor
fuel consumption. Battery power can be
restored  by  driving  with  the  accelerator
pedal slightly released.

WARNING

Be careful where you park and drive;
the  catalytic  converter  and  other
exhaust  components  can  get  very

How to Use Air Conditioning Sys-
tem Effectively

Parking under the blazing sun
After  parking  for  a  long  time  under  the
blazing  sun,  the  interior  temperature  can
become very high. Use the air conditioning
system, with the windows or doors opened
to ventilate the interior.",What should you do if you need maximum defrosting in your car?,"To achieve maximum defrosting in your car, follow these steps:
1) Push the defrost switch to turn on the defroster.
2) Set the blower speed selector to HIGH.
3) Adjust the temperature selector to the ""HI"" indication on the display.
4) Adjust the side outlets so that the air blows on the side windows."
"Maintenance
If  you  do  not  use  the  air  conditioner  for  a
long  period,  such  as  during  winter,  it  may
not  give  the  best  performance  when  you
start  using  it  again. To  help  maintain  opti-
mum performance and durability of your air
conditioner, it needs to be run periodically.
Operate the air conditioner at least once a
month  for  one  minute  with  the  engine
idling. This circulates the refrigerant and oil
and helps protect the internal components.
Your air conditioner is equipped with air fil-
ters. Clean or replace them as specified in
“Maintenance  Schedule”  in  the  “INSPEC-
TION AND MAINTENANCE” section. Have
this  job  done  by  a  Maruti  Suzuki  autho-
rized  workshop  as  the  lower  glove  box
must be lowered for this job.",Why is it important to run the air conditioner periodically even if it is not being used for a long period of time?,"It is important to run the air conditioner periodically even if it is not being used for a long period of time to maintain its optimum performance and durability. Running the air conditioner for at least one minute with the engine idling helps circulate the refrigerant and oil, which in turn helps protect the internal components of the air conditioner."
"NOTE:
Your  vehicle  uses  the  air  conditioning
refrigerant  HFC-134a,  commonly  called
R-134a.  R-134a  replaced  R-12  around
1993  for  automotive  applications.  Other
refrigerants  are  available,  including  recy-
cled R-12, but only R-134a should be used
in your vehicle.

Trailer Towing
Your  vehicle  was  originally  designed  to
carry  people  and  a  normal  amount  of
cargo, not to tow a trailer.

VEHICLE LOADING AND TOWING",What should you avoid using when cleaning the charging pad?,"You should avoid using oil, grease, alcohol, benzene, or thinner when cleaning the charging pad."
"VEHICLE LOADING AND TOWING

Vehicle Loading
Your  vehicle  was  designed  for  specific
weight capacities. The weight capacities of
your  vehicle  are  indicated  by  the  Gross
Vehicle  Weight  Rating  (GVWR)  and  the
Permissible  maximum Axle  Weight  (PAW,
front and rear). The GVWR and PAW (front
and  rear)  are  listed  in  the  “SPECIFICA-
TIONS” section.

GVWR  –  Maximum  permissible  overall
weight of the fully loaded vehicle (including
all  the  occupants,  accessories  and  cargo
plus  the  trailer  nose  weight  if  towing  a
trailer).
PAW – (Front and Rear) Maximum permis-
sible weight on an individual axle.",What is the purpose of the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW) in a vehicle?,"The purpose of the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW) in a vehicle is to indicate the maximum weight that the vehicle can safely carry, including the weight of the occupants, accessories, cargo, and even the trailer nose weight if towing a trailer. The GVWR represents the maximum overall weight of the fully loaded vehicle, while the PAW indicates the maximum weight that each individual axle can bear."
"Actual  weight  of  the  loaded  vehicle  and
actual loads at the front and rear axles can
only  be  determined  by  weighing  the  vehi-
cle. Compare these weights to the GVWR
and PAW (front and rear). If the gross vehi-
cle  weight  or  the  load  on  either  axle
exceeds  these  ratings,  you  must  remove
enough  weight  to  bring  the  load  down  to
the rated capacity.

WARNING

• Never  overload  your  vehicle.  The
gross  vehicle  weight  (sum  of  the
weights of the vehicle, all the occu-
pants,  accessories,  cargo  plus
if  towing  a
trailer  nose  weight 
trailer)  must  never  exceed 
the
Gross  Vehicle  Weight  Rating
(GVWR).  In  addition,  never  distrib-
ute  a  load  so  that  the  weight  on
either the front or rear axle exceeds
the  Permissible  maximum  Axle
Weight (PAW).",What should you do if the gross vehicle weight or the load on either axle exceeds the ratings?,"If the gross vehicle weight or the load on either axle exceeds the ratings, you must remove enough weight to bring the load down to the rated capacity."
"• Always  distribute  cargo  evenly.  To
avoid personal injury or damage to
your  vehicle,  always  secure  cargo
to  prevent  it  from  shifting  if  the
vehicle  moves  suddenly.  Place
heavier objects on the floor and as
far  forward  in  the  cargo  area  as
possible.  Never  pile  cargo  higher
than the top of the seat backs.

SUZUKI genuine coolant or equivalent.

This type of coolant is the best for cooling
system for the following reasons:
• The  coolant  helps  maintain  proper

engine temperature.

• It  gives  proper  protection  against  freez-

ing and boiling.

• It  gives  proper  protection  against  corro-

sion and rust.",What is the recommended tightening torque for the oil filter?,"The recommended tightening torque for the oil filter is 3/4 turn or 14 Nm (1.4 kg-m, 10.3 lb-ft)."
"ing and boiling.

• It  gives  proper  protection  against  corro-

sion and rust.

Failure to use the proper coolant can dam-
age  your  cooling  system.  Your  Maruti
Suzuki authorized workshop can help you
select the proper coolant.

NOTICE
To avoid damaging your cooling sys-
tem:
• Always use a high quality ethylene
glycol  base  non-silicate  type  cool-
ant  diluted  with  distilled  water  at
the correct mixture concentration.
• Check  that  the  proper  mix  is  50/50
coolant to distilled water and in no
case higher than 70/30. Concentra-
tions  greater  than  70/30  coolant  to
distilled  water  will  cause  overheat-
ing conditions.

• Do  not  use  straight  coolant  nor

plain water.

• Do not add extra inhibitors or addi-
tives.  They  may  not  be  compatible
with your cooling system.",What type of coolant should be used in the cooling system of a car?,A high quality ethylene glycol base non-silicate type coolant should be used in the cooling system of a car.
"• Do  not  mix  different  types  of  base
coolants.  Doing  so  may  result  in
accelerated  seal  wear  and/or  the
possibility  of  severe  overheating
and  extensive  engine/automatic
transmission damage.

INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE

Refilling with Oil and Oil Leakage 
Check
1) Pour  oil  through  the  filler  hole  and

install the filler cap. 
For the approximate capacity of the oil,
refer to “Recommended fuel / lubricants
and  capacities  (approx.)”  in  “SPECIFI-
CATIONS” section.

2) Start the engine and carefully check the
oil filter and the drain plug for leakage.
Run the engine at various speeds for at
least 5 minutes.

3) Stop the engine and wait about 5 min-
utes. Check the oil level again and add
oil  if  necessary.  Check  for  leakage
again.",What should be done if different types of base coolants are mixed?,"If different types of base coolants are mixed, it may result in accelerated seal wear and/or the possibility of severe overheating and extensive engine/automatic transmission damage."
"NOTICE
• When  replacing  the  oil  filter,  it  is
recommended that you use a genu-
ine  MARUTI  SUZUKI  replacement
filter.  If  you  use  an  aftermarket  fil-
ter,  check  that  it  is  of  equivalent
quality  and  follow  the  manufac-
turer’s instructions.

• Oil  leakage  from  the  periphery  of
the  oil  filter  or  drain  plug  indicate
incorrect 
installation  or  gasket
damage. If you find any leakage or
are not sure that the filter has been
properly  tightened,  have  the  vehi-
cle  inspected  by  a  Maruti  Suzuki
authorized workshop.

INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE

If  you  need  to  replace  the  following  bulbs
indicated  in  the  above  table,  consult  a
Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

*1:  Since  the  lights  are  non-disassemble
type,  you  cannot  replace  a  bulb.
Replace  the  target  assembly  if  any
bulb is defective.

CAUTION",What should you do if any bulb is defective in the non-disassemble type lights mentioned in the table?,"If any bulb is defective in the non-disassemble type lights mentioned in the table, you should replace the target assembly."
"CAUTION

• Light  bulbs  can  be  hot  enough  to
burn your finger right after turning
off lights. This is true especially for
halogen  headlight  bulbs.  Replace
the  bulbs  after  they  become  cool
enough.

• The  headlight  bulbs  are  filled  with
pressurized halogen gas. They can
burst  and  injure  you  if  they  are  hit
or dropped. Handle them carefully.
• To  avoid  injury  by  sharp-edged
parts of the body, wear gloves and
a long-sleeved shirt when replacing
light bulbs.

9-29

NOTICE
• The oils from your skin may cause
a  halogen  bulb  to  overheat  and
burst when the lights are on. Grasp
a new bulb with a clean cloth.

• Frequent  bulb  replacement  indi-
cates the need for an inspection of
the  electrical  system.  This  should
be  carried  out  by  a  Maruti  Suzuki
authorized workshop.

• During  bulb  replacement  always
use  same  bulb  number  as  used  in
vehicle  which  is  imprinted  on  the
said  bulb/unit  and/or  mentioned  in
this section.",What precautions should be taken when replacing light bulbs in a vehicle?,"When replacing light bulbs in a vehicle, it is important to take the following precautions:

1. Allow the bulbs to cool down before handling them, especially halogen headlight bulbs, as they can be hot enough to burn your fingers.

2. Handle the bulbs carefully, as they are filled with pressurized halogen gas and can burst if hit or dropped, potentially causing injury.

3. Wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt to protect yourself from sharp-edged parts of the body while replacing light bulbs.

4. Use a clean cloth to grasp a new bulb, as the oils from your skin can cause a halogen bulb to overheat and burst when the lights are on.

5. If you frequently need to replace bulbs, it may indicate a need for an inspection of the electrical system, which should be carried out by a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

6. Always use the same bulb number as used in the vehicle, which is imprinted on the bulb/unit or mentioned in the car manual guide."
"NOTE:
The  inner  surface  of  lens  such  as  the
headlights  or  the  rear  combination  lights
may be clouded or dew condensation may
occur by driving on a rainy day or washing
the vehicle. This is a temporary phenome-
non  caused  by  temperature  difference
between the  inside and  the outside  of the
lights.  (This  is  the  same  phenomenon  as
the windows are clouded on a rainy day.)
Also,  it  sometimes  seems  that  water  gets
into the lights because of water drop on the
edge of the lens. This is a temporary phe-
nomenon  caused  by  water  adherence  to
the outside of the lights.
The above-mentioned phenomena are not
vehicle malfunction.

However, if water is piled up in the lights or
large  waterdrop  adheres  to  the  inner  sur-
face  of  lens,  have  your  vehicle  inspected
by a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.",What are the possible causes of clouded or dew condensation on the inner surface of the headlights or rear combination lights?,"The possible causes of clouded or dew condensation on the inner surface of the headlights or rear combination lights are the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the lights, similar to how windows get clouded on a rainy day, and water adherence to the outside of the lights due to water drops on the edge of the lens."
"Non-disassembled Type Lights
Since the lights shown below are non-dis-
assemble type, you cannot replace a bulb.
Replace the target assembly if any bulb is
defective.
If  you  need  to  replace  the  assembly,  ask
your Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

points:

• Continuous exposure to sunlight
• Hard  water  &  sea  water  coming  in  con-

tact with vehicle.

• Foot rubbing (skirting).

How to Help Prevent Corrosion
Wash your vehicle frequently
The best way to preserve the finish on your
vehicle  and  to  help  avoid  corrosion  is  to
keep it clean with frequent washing.
Wash your vehicle at least once during the
winter and once immediately after the win-
ter.  Keep  your  vehicle,  particularly  the
underside, as clean and dry as possible.
If  you  frequently  drive  on  salted  roads,
your  vehicle  should  be  washed  at  least
once a month during the winter. If you live
near  the  ocean,  your  vehicle  should  be
washed at least once a  month throughout
the year.

For washing instructions, refer to “Cleaning
Exterior” section.

sion.  Occasionally,  check  under  these
mats to ensure that this area is clean and
dry. More frequent checks are necessary if
the vehicle is used for off-road driving or in
wet weather.
Certain cargos such as chemicals, fertiliz-
ers, cleaners, salts, etc. are extremely cor-
rosive  by  nature.  These  products  should
be transported in sealed containers. If they

Fuel Recommendation
Petrol Engine
To avoid damaging catalytic converter, you
must  use  unleaded  petrol  with  an  octane
number (RON) of 91 or higher.",What type of petrol should be used for a petrol engine to avoid damaging the catalytic converter?,"To avoid damaging the catalytic converter, unleaded petrol with an octane number (RON) of 91 or higher should be used for a petrol engine."
"Gasoline/Ethanol blends
Blends  of  unleaded  gasoline  and  ethanol
(grain alcohol), also known as gasohol, are
commercially  available  in  certain  areas.
Blends  of  this  type  are  recommended  for
this  vehicle  if  they  are  no  more  than  10%
ethanol. The vehicle may also be plied with
blend of no more than 20% ethanol.

NOTE:
If you are not satisfied with the driveability
or fuel economy of your vehicle when you
are using 20% ethanol blend, you should
switch back to blend of no more than 10%
ethanol.

Gasoline containing MTBE
Unleaded  gasoline  containing  MTBE
(methyl tertiary butyl ether) may be used in
your  vehicle  if  the  MTBE  content  is  not
greater  than  15%.  This  oxygenated  fuel
does not contain alcohol.

CAUTION

Use of spurious, low quality, adulter-
ated  fuel  can  cause  damage  to  the
engine and engine auxilliaries, affect
functioning  of  engine  and  degrade
engine  performance 
including  but
not limited to engine seizure.",What types of gasoline/ethanol blends are recommended for this vehicle?,"Blends of unleaded gasoline and ethanol, also known as gasohol, are recommended for this vehicle if they are no more than 10% ethanol. The vehicle may also be plied with a blend of no more than 20% ethanol."
"NOTICE
• The  fuel  tank  has  an  air  space  to
allow  for  fuel  expansion  in  hot
weather. If you continue to add fuel
after the filler nozzle has automati-
cally shut off or an initial blowback
occurs, 
the  air  chamber  will
become  full.  Exposure  to  heat
when  fully  fuelled  in  this  manner
will  result  in    leakage  due  to  fuel
expansion.  To  prevent  such  fuel
leakage,  stop  filling  after  the  filler
nozzle  has  automatically  shut  off,
or  when 
initial  vent  blowback
occurs, if using an alternative non-
automatic system.

• Be careful not to spill fuel contain-
ing alcohol while refueling. If fuel is
spilled on the vehicle body, wipe it
up  immediately.  Fuels  containing
alcohol  can  cause  paint  damage,
which  is  not  covered  under  the
New Vehicle Limited Warranty.
